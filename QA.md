Can I use options in the input for open-ended questions?

> No you can not. Open-ended questions require first prompt the model without providing the answer options from the dataset, allowing it to generate an open-ended response. In the second evaluation step, this open-ended answer is then mapped to a single option. We will review the reasoning trace during our qualification check to ensure this process is followed.

Should prompts be fixed during submission?
> You can change the prompt.
